&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the first post on my blog.
For a long time, I wanted to have a blog to document stuff so that
I could refer back to them later. Back then in 2010, I looked at Blogger,
Wordpress and Tumblr. I did not like them as I had very limited 
control over the&amp;nbsp;design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Static Site Generators and Github hosting means I can have all the freedom
at zero cost. There is no dearth of Static site generators these days.
I have tried &lt;a href="http://getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://jekyllrb.com"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/"&gt;Hakyll&lt;/a&gt; and feel pelican suits me&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelican is a Python based static site generator. You can install it from PyPI
using pip. I spend a lot of time writing Python particularly for Scientific
computing, so it was a natural choice for me. At the time there were no good
themes for pelican and I did not have the know-how or the time to create one
myself. So I tried the most popular of all Static site generators,&amp;nbsp;Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is created by the founder of Github, Tom Preston Werner. Like all projects
officially backed by Github, it looks cool. It is Open Source, has a beautiful
website, documentation and loads of good looking themes.
I liked Jekyll a lot, especially the fact that I can directly push markdown to
my repo rather than the html generated from markdown. However, I never used Ruby.
So I did not want to install Ruby, Jekyll and its many dependencies on my
computer just for blogging. As of this writing Jekyll is still not officially
supported on&amp;nbsp;Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2014, when I was around half way through Learn You A Haskell book,
I wanted a project to apply my newly acquired haskell knowledge. That&amp;#8217;s how I
stumbled on &lt;a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/"&gt;Hakyll&lt;/a&gt;. Hakyll is very similar to Jekyll,
and it worked very well for me on Windows. The trouble started when I tried to
reuse source files from Windows on Archlinux. First the infamous Cabal Hell and
as though that was not enough when I got everything working, the config files 
were doing different things on Windows and&amp;nbsp;Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cool as Haskell is, I am not as comfortable with Haskell as I am with Python.
Eventually I came back to Pelican which I tried first when I found a theme of my
liking. Pelican&amp;#8217;s stability also should help me concentrate on writing the content.
I wanted a simple website that will keep the focus on content and I think
what I have now is perfect in that&amp;nbsp;respect.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>

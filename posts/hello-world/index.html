<p>Over the years, whenever I sat down to create a website, I would get stumped trying to figure
out details of hosting. Moreover I always wanted to have a blog to write down stuff so that
I could refer back later. Back then in 2010, I looked at Blogger,
Wordpress and Tumblr. I did not like them as I had very limited 
control over the&nbsp;design.</p>
<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> provide a very reliable hosting option
for static sites at zero cost.
As for blogging, there is no dearth of <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">Static site generators</a> these days.
It feels like a new one comes and goes everyday just like javascript frameworks
do by the hour. I have tried <a href="http://getpelican.com" title="Pelican">Pelican</a>, <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" title="Jekyll Home Page">Jekyll</a>,
and <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/" title="Hakyll">Hakyll</a>.</p>
<p>Pelican is a Python based static site generator. You can install it from PyPI
using pip. I spend a lot of time writing Python particularly for Scientific
computing, so it was a natural choice for me. At the time there were no good
themes for pelican and I did not have the know-how or the time to create one
myself. Next I tried ,&nbsp;Jekyll.</p>
<p>Jekyll is created by <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/">Tom Preston Werner</a>,
cofounder of Github. Like all projects
<a href="https://atom.io/">officially</a> backed by Github, it looks cool. It
has a beautiful
website, lots of documentation and loads of good looking themes.
I liked Jekyll a lot, especially the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/">fact</a> that I can directly push markdown to
my repo rather than the html generated from markdown. However, I never used Ruby.
So I did not want to install Ruby, Jekyll and its many dependencies on my
computer just for blogging. As of this writing Jekyll is still not officially
supported on&nbsp;Windows.</p>
<p>In December 2014, when I was around half way through <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You A Haskell</a>,
I wanted a project to apply my newly acquired haskell knowledge. That&#8217;s how I
stumbled on <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a>. Hakyll is very similar to Jekyll,
and it worked very well for me on Windows. The trouble started when I tried to
reuse source files from Windows on Archlinux. First the infamous Cabal Hell and
as though that was not enough when I got everything working, the config files 
were doing different things on Windows and&nbsp;Linux.</p>
<p>Haskell is a very cool language but currently I am not as comfortable in
Haskell as I am in Python<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Eventually I came back to Pelican, when I found a theme of my liking. Pelican&#8217;s stability
also should help me concentrate on writing the content.
I wanted a simple website that will keep the focus on content and I think
what I have now is perfect in that&nbsp;respect.</p>

<p>I intend to rectify this,  a lot of good software is written in Haskell especially
<a href="http://xmonad.org/">Xmonad</a>, <a href="http://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> and <a href="http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams/">Diagrams</a>, but it seems like I always have a big list of
languages to learn. Currently this  list includes Haskell, Lisp and Lua.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
